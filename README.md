EmailAdministration System with SQL Integration

Email Administration System with SQL Integration
A Java-based application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, designed to manage employee email accounts efficiently. 
The system allows the creation of custom email addresses, department assignment, mailbox management, and secure password generation. 
With SQL integration, employee data (name, department, email, and mailbox capacity) is stored and managed in a relational database, ensuring data persistence and scalability.
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of OOP concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity.
